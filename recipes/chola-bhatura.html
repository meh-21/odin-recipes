    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>
      A piece of hot & puffed-up bhatura with a tangy & spicy chickpea curry
      with salad and pickle on the side, what else can you ask for? Well, yes we
      are talking about the Chole Bhature recipe, which is loved by North
      Indians. This delicacy has Punjabi origins and thus you can imagine the
      taste of this dish. Here's how you can make it at home with detailed
      instructions explained with step-by-step images.
    </p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>2 cups soaked overnight chickpeas</li>
      <li>2 chopped onions</li>
      <li>1/4 cup tomato puree</li>
      <li>1 teaspoon coriander powder</li>
      <li>5 cloves garlic</li>
      <li>1/2 teaspoon turmeric</li>
      <li>1 1/2 teaspoons chana masala powder</li>
      <li>1 teaspoon cumin</li>
      <li>1 tablespoon ginger</li>
      <li>3 tablespoons onion paste</li>
      <li>Salt (as required)</li>
      <li>1 teaspoon garam masala powder</li>
      <li>1 teaspoon red chilli powder</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
      <li>Pressure cook the chickpeas</li>
      <p>
        To prepare the chole, soak chickpeas in water overnight or for 6-8
        hours. Then, put a pressure cooker on high flame and add the soaked
        chickpeas in it along with salt to taste and 1 tea bag or you can also
        put 2-3 tea leaves and wrap it in a cloth. Cook the chickpeas for 15-20
        minutes. (Note: The tea leaves or the tea bag will change the colour of
        gravy from dark brown to black.)
      </p>
      <li>Saute the onion</li>
      <p>
        Meanwhile, put a pan on medium flame and heat a little oil in it. Add
        the cumin seeds and sliced onion to the pan. Saute the onion till golden
        brown, then add minced garlic, ginger and onion paste. Saute the
        ingredients for a few seconds until the raw smell of garlic goes away
        and then add tomato puree.
      </p>
      <li>Add spices and cook the chole</li>
      <p>
        Once the oil is separated, add turmeric, red chilli powder, coriander
        powder and chana masala. Cook the tomato-onion mixture for another two
        minutes, and then add cooked chole with little water. Stir well to mix
        the masala with the chole or the chickpeas. Check salt and allow it to
        cook for a few minutes. The chola is done! You can garnish with chopped
        onion and coriander leaves.
      </p>
      <li>Prepare the dough</li>
      <p>
        Now for making the bhaturas, combine together all-purpose flour or maida
        and wheat flour or atta in a dough kneading plate. Then add salt and oil
        to it. Mix well. Add yoghurt to the flour mixture and knead the dough
        well. You can add a little water and knead the dough. When it is done,
        cover the dough with a kitchen towel and allow it to rise.
      </p>
      <li>Cook the bhatura and serve</li>
      <p>
        Now, put a kadhai on high flame and meanwhile, take equal quantities of
        the dough and roll big size puris (bhatura). When the oil is hot enough,
        carefully add these bhaturas to the oil and deep fry. Repeat with the
        rest of the dough. Then take a plate and serve Chola bhatura hot!
