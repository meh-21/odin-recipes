    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>
      Rajma is the Hindi word for kidney beans. However, this delicious
      vegetarian curry is so popular that the recipe has become synonymous with
      the bean. Both the beans themselves and this dish that features them are
      known as Rajma. <br />
      <br />
      Another name for this yummy and satisfying dish is Rajma Masala, which
      translates to “red kidney beans in spiced gravy.” Whatever you call it,
      you’re sure to love these melt-in-your-mouth rajma beans and the creamy
      spiced gravy that accompanies them.

      <li>1 tablespoon garlic</li>
      <li>2 chopped green chillies</li>
      <li>1 tablespoon cumin powder</li>

      <li>1 tablespoon ghee</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
      <li>Soak rajma overnight and pressure cook till they are soft</li>
      <p>
        Wash the rajma and allow it to soak in water overnight. Wash it again
        and pressure cook with 2 cups of water, 1/2 tsp salt and turmeric. Once
        the rajma is soft and squishy, remove it from the heat and keep it
        aside.
      </p>
      <li>Chop onion-tomato and make ginger-garlic paste</li>
      <p>
        Finely chop onions and keep aside, grate the tomatoes and keep them
        aside. Make a paste of ginger, garlic and green chillies.
      </p>
      <li>Prepare the rajma</li>
      <p>
        In a deep bottomed pan, add mustard oil, when it gets heated add green
        cardamom, black cardamom, cinnamon, clove, peppercorn. Once they become
        fragrant, add onions and cook till they are golden brown. Now add the
        tomatoes and cook on high for 4-5 minutes. Add ginger- garlic-chilli
        paste, cumin powder, coriander powder and black pepper powder. Cook till
        the spices become fragrant and oil starts leaving the sides of the pan.
        Now add the rajma and one cup of water. Mix well and cook covered for 10
        minutes. Once done, add the ghee. You can garnish with coriander leaves.
        Your rajma is ready.
      </p>
      <li>Steam cook rice and serve with Rajma</li>
      <p>
        To make steamed rice without using a pressure cooker, wash 1 cup of rice
        in running water. Then, add them to a large and deep-bottomed pan with
        4-5 cups of water in it. You can also add a little salt to it for taste.
        Once the rice is soft and double its size, strain the water. Spread the
        rice on a plate and allow it to cool for 2-3 minutes. Once the rice is
        done, serve hot with prepared Rajma.
