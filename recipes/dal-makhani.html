    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>2 cups soaked overnight red kidney beans</li>
      <li>1 teaspoon red chilli powder</li>
      <li>4 tablespoons butter</li>
      <li>1 large chopped onion</li>
      <li>1/2 cup tomato puree</li>
      <li>1/2 cup fresh cream</li>
      <li>1/2 teaspoon ginger paste</li>
      <li>Water (as required)</li>
      <li>Salt (as required)</li>
      <li>2 inches chopped ginger</li>
      <li>1 tablespoon refined oil</li>
      <li>2 medium sliced & slit green chillies</li>
      <li>1 teaspoon garam masala powder</li>
      <li>1/2 cup soaked overnight urad dal</li>
      <li>1/2 teaspoon garlic paste</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
      <li>Soak urad, rajma overnight & pressure cook the next day</li>
      <p>
        To prepare this popular dish, soak sabut urad and rajma overnight in
        three cups of water. Drain it and pressure cook in 6 cups of water with
        salt as per taste. This makes the rajma and dal soft.
      </p>
      <li>Fry the onions, green chillies & tomato puree</li>
      <p>
        Take a kadhai on medium flame, then heat the oil and add the cumin
        seeds. Once the cumin seeds crackle, you can add half the ginger-garlic
        paste and stir for some time. Then add some onions, chopped green
        chillies and tomato puree. Fry until the mix turns golden. If you are
        someone who loves the authentic style of Dal Makhani, then we suggest
        you to use ghee instead of oil.
      </p>
      <li>Add the rajma & dal</li>
      <p>
        Once the bhuna masala is ready you can add the pressure cooked Rajma and
        dal, and bring to a boil. If you want your Dal Makhani to be smooth, you
        can grind the masala first and then add the dal and Rajma.
      </p>
      <li>
        Add the garam masala & garnish with fresh cream & coriander leaves
      </li>
      <p>
        Then add garam masala and salt as per your taste. Stir well and bring to
        boil, if you think that the dal is too thick, you can add some water.
        Then add some fresh cream to this recipe and stir well. This will make
        your Dal Makhani creamy and delicious. Garnish this recipe with fresh
        cream and freshly chopped coriander leaves.
